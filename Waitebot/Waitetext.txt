There is little so beloved among journalists as The Truth. If there were anything approaching religion in the newsroom, The Truth would be the deity. It feels good to be a part of The Truth. It gives your work a greater purpose. A nobility of sorts.
But is this what we really seek, The Truth? Are we faithful congregants? I see a lot of data journalism that makes me wonder. Do we really understand Truth? Is that even the goal of what we do? And are we doing enough, as data journalists/app developers/data visualizers to arrive at The Truth? To facilitate it? As a sinner, I wonder.
So, I’ve been wallowing in the Liberal Arts side of my head lately. I’ve been wandering the philosophy section on the internet, reading about Truth, Knowledge, and epistemology, trying like hell to get out of the very practical, mission-focused side of me and really think about why I’m uncomfortable with a lot of data journalism lately. And I think I have it.
It’s doubt.
Too often, we use numbers with blind faith, as if they were handed down from on high and we mere mortals are not to question them. We do not communicate doubt in our own findings, or anyone else’s for that matter. Most of us recognize that data is dirty, flawed, and noisy. We admit that often the data we have has a point of view—it was gathered for a specific purpose, and that purpose isn’t always our purpose. Lately, an uncomfortable amount of the data we write about has been poorly gathered by a marketing company hoping we’ll take the bait. Also, we know that human beings often gathered this data, which means there are errors in it. But how often do we communicate that to readers?
Rarely.
Even if we do try to communicate doubt to readers, I wonder if we possess the right language to express it. My head was sent spinning reading Jordan Ellenberg’s How Not To Be Wrong this summer. The book is filled with all kinds of mathematical thinking, but one of the most powerful parts of it is where he explains just what statistical significance really is. Put plainly, it just means something is extremely unlikely to have happened by chance. If you’ve studied statistics, I think you probably know that. But, if you’re like me, that didn’t completely do away with the loaded meaning of “significance.” You, like me, thought statistical significance meant it isn’t random and that Means Something, which may not be the case at all. It might be statistically significant and utterly unimportant.
How many of our readers know that? How many of our readers know to even question that?
Most often what passes for data journalism these days comes in the form of strident, confident, and declarative statements with Findings You Won’t Believe. Or we blithely claim we can explain some massively complex situation in X number of charts, where X is almost always less than the number of fingers on one hand. And we leave absolutely nothing to question. Our need for Authority demands it.
I think the effects of this are becoming clear. And they aren’t good.
A recent warning sign, if you need one, came from Margaret Sullivan, the New York Times’ Public Editor, who asks “Why Didn’t the Data-Driven Media See Eric Cantor’s Defeat Coming?” The question implies that because there’s data in the world, data journalists should have seen what is a colossally rare thing coming. A sitting party majority leader losing to an economics professor who raised a tiny fraction of the incumbent’s cash and skipped campaign events because of finals week at his university—I mean, who couldn’t predict that?
I believe questions like this come from the mistaken notion that data means there’s no doubt about what comes from it. Numbers = Truth. And it’s our collective tendency toward the declarative that fosters this idea.
Recently, Zeynep Tufekci got at some of my angst in criticizing 538’s blown prediction of Brazil beating Germany in the World Cup. 538 had Brazil winning it all, and even without their most talented player and team captain, they predicted a win over Germany in the semi-finals. Final result: Germany 7, Brazil 1.
“All measurements are partial, incorrect reflections,” Tufekci wrote in a post you should read. “We are always in Plato’s Cave. Everything is a partial shadow. There is no perfect data, big or otherwise. All researchers should repeat this to themselves, and even more importantly, to the general public to avoid giving the impression that some kinds of data have special magic sauce that make them error-free. Nope.”
And the Truth Shall Set You Free
This jeremiad started with my worry about our struggles with recognizing and communicating the difference between capital-T Truth and truth, lowercased.
The canon of philosophical thinking about truth, to put it mildly, is long. And unless you’re a really big fan of that kind of writing, it’s taxing. I’ve found math textbooks that were more readable. You’d think something so fundamental as truth would be a simple thing, but you’d be very, very wrong. To save you the time, there are a ton of theories of truth, and among the first is the correspondence theory of truth. Simply put, the correspondence theory says that what we say or think is true so long as it corresponds with the facts. Simple right?
Wrong.
Let me ask you a question: The U.S. Census Bureau says that my town of Lincoln, Neb. has 265,389 people in it. Does it?
Answer? Yes. And no.
Let’s peel back some layers here. The U.S. Census is mandated by the Constitution, and requires the government to count every man, woman, and child in the country every 10 years. Courts have held that the Constitution literally requires a headcount, meaning no sampling or guessing or imputation or anything.
So, the whole thing is doomed from the start. Homeless people are hard to find, undocumented immigrants don’t exactly want to chat with government agents, and the same goes for tin-foil hat conspiracy theorists/sovereign citizen/anti-government folks. But the government tries anyway. And they publish a number. That number is the number of people they counted on April 1 of the first year of that decade (2010 was the last one). Now, that number is published long after April 1—the first numbers usually come out about 8 months after and then more trickle out over time.
The problem? One day after April 1, the data, which is wrong to begin with, is wrong-er. How? People die. People are born. People move. People go to jail. Life goes on. The data does not.
Between the decennial census, the Census Bureau uses sampling methods to estimate the population year after year. Those numbers have a sampling error, which makes wrong numbers that are frozen in time…something.
But does Lincoln have 265,389 people? Yeah, around there. It’s about right. It’s true, not True. It’s as correct as we have any hope of finding out. It’s true without being scientifically, according to Hoyle, 100 percent accurate.
And that’s the difference between Capital T Truth and lowercase t truth. Capital T truth, by some philosophical constructs, exists only in the realm of religion or science, if at all. Things like “God is good,” “light moves at 299,792,458 meters per second,” etc., are Truth to those who believe. They are the incontrovertible basis of a life’s work for those who believe: a foundation, core. All else is truth.
Space Cameras and Epistemic Justification
Where my mind was opened to this was in remote sensing—data pictures taken from space. And it was a professor at the University of South Florida, Barnali Dixon, that let me into her remote sensing class, who blew my mind with this Truth vs truth idea.
Think about it this way: Walk outside. Find a tree. Walk up to it. Describe it to someone who has no idea what a tree is. In describing it, you’re likely to reach out and touch it, right? Because you can touch it. You can look closely at it. You can interact with it. You know things about it. It is real to you. With sensors, you can measure things about it, and you can do so easily because you are standing next to it.
Now, take a picture of that tree from space and do the same thing. Given a powerful enough sensor, you will be able to see it. You’ll be able to describe it in meaningful ways. You can say things about the leaves, or the size of the tree. But, there are thousands of feet of atmosphere between the tree and the sensor. There are changes in the air density and makeup, in particulate matter in the air, in cloud cover. All of those things—and more—can alter the data recorded by the sensor and analyzed by you. Greens aren’t as bright, infrared radiation values get skewed, what you know about the tree changes, if only slightly. You will perceive the tree differently than you will standing next to it. Those descriptions may be true in the light of the data you have, but they are not True in the way being able to touch the tree makes them True. They will not match the sensor values you got standing next to it. It’s the consequence of the remote part of remote sensing.
In other words, remotely sensed data will tell us things about the world that are broadly true, but they will never be True. They can’t be. There’s too much distance between the object and the sensor. Too much to go wrong. But that doesn’t make what the sensor tells us wrong. It makes it something else. It introduces doubt.
And that brings us to epistemic justification. Epistemology, broadly speaking, is the branch of philosophy that is concerned with knowledge, and how we know what we know. Epistemology, like Truth, is another area of philosophy that’s dauntingly large and complex. But epistemic justification can be boiled down like this: Knowledge is when we believe something to be true and we have something to justify that belief, like facts or observations.
Data journalism spends a lot of time on the first part of epistemic justification—believing something is true and writing about it as if it were—while giving incomplete attention to the second part: the justification for that belief.
Before I get too far into philosophical debates, let’s talk about journalism again.
For a story, I spent 10 months analyzing Landsat imagery of the state of Florida, looking for wetlands that had been replaced by urbanized uses. Using a method that combined painstaking visual analysis with some data filtering using other imagery layers, the then-St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) determined, conservatively, that 84,000 acres of wetlands had been lost to urbanization—which is remarkable, in the fact that federal and state regulations say that’s not supposed to happen to such an extent.
As part of this story—which was the first of four award-winning investigative stories produced over two years—we published our complete methodology. In it, we published exact results of our assessments of the work I did—warts and all. To wit:
The accuracy of the Times analysis was then formally assessed, using a random set of 385 points—enough for a 95 percent confidence level with a plus or minus 5 percent confidence interval where the distribution of the data is unknown—generated in ArcGIS through Hawth’s Analysis Tools. The points were visually inspected to ensure spatial randomness, and further tested using spatial density analysis. Overall accuracy of the analysis was around 80 percent for both image years. However, wetlands accuracy for both years was around 66 percent, and errors were largely of commission—calling something a wetland that wasn’t. Errors were primarily misclassifications of certain kinds of agriculture—i.e. sugar—and misclassifications of wetlands forest types that share similar spectral characteristics of non-wetlands forest types. Relying on only the Times analysis would be a mistake, based on several factors. Using single date imagery for wetlands change detection has been found many times over to be less accurate than using multi-date imagery, owing partly to seasonal changes in wetlands (Lunetta and Balogh (1999), Ozesmi and Bauer (2001), Reese et. al (2002)). And, the two image years use different sensors—Landsat 5 TM for one, and Landsat 7 ETM+ for another—which creates some sensor-based differences that can’t be extracted or accounted for.
How often do you see a news organization saying that relying on their own analysis alone would be a mistake? Frankly, nine years later, I now wonder if the editors even read this part of the story.
But look at what we did: We formally assessed the accuracy of our work, we found it lacking, and we devised a method to overcome it. Then, we detailed that method, and formally assessed the outcome. And we published it all. In the end, our analysis met the standards for peer-reviewed remote sensing work.
Should every data story do this? No. Not hardly. There’s no time. And not every story is worth assessing this way. But a broader, more systemic step toward this kind of transparency is warranted.
But how?
Let’s Make Some Fake Software
Let’s get back to practical for a moment. What if we were to make an epistemic software layer for news? Like Vox’s cards, except for doubt. Let’s even call it Doubt.js. And because I’m incapable of being this serious for this long, let’s make it tag phrases based on data with animated gifs, because that’s what the internet demands. What would it do?
First and foremost, I think it needs to signal to readers when there’s doubt about something. It may be fine to include a fact, or some data, or someone’s conclusions about something, even if there’s doubt. It may be all we have. Or maybe this story may be for fun—Top Colleges for This Major!—and we don’t really care about the methodology because we’re not taking it seriously. I don’t have a problem with data stories for fun, we just need to let people in on the joke. Here’s this data set, it’s not serious, but what the hell let’s take a look anyway.
So, our system would have a place where we could annotate a data source with the doubts we have about it. And there would be levels of doubt. For fun and the sake of argument, let’s have rock solid, pretty good, danger zone, and lolz this is crap. Add some data-driven fact to the story, add your doubt to our backend, tag the factoid with one of our levels, and Doubt.js will add a little link or icon inline that shows a pop-up card explaining why we tagged it that way. And on those popup cards you’d see something like this:
A small step toward solving the “our curriculum is too full” problem
One of the arguments used to push back against adding new things into journalism school curricula is “Our curriculum is too full! We can’t possibly add anything more! What are we going to do? Stop teaching writing? Or editing?”
First, the argument is silly — no one said anyone was going to stop teaching writing or reporting or whatever “fundamental” skill is most beloved by the combatant. 
Second, it’s not an either or problem.
Put another way, you can view a crowded curriculum as a challenge or a lament. Too many view it as a lament and throw their hands up.
I’ve started picking away at this problem — viewing it as the challenge that it is — by focusing on a specific class: beginning reporting.
Let’s start with a set of statements:
I believe that all reporting classes need to beef up the amount of data journalism contained in them. Data is everywhere, and thus it’s part of modern journalism, and thus it should be in every reporting class.
I believe the level of mathematics education that most journalism schools require (if any at all) is far too low.
I believe the inside-joke “journalists are bad at math ha ha” has to stop.
Given that, the place to start is beginning reporting. Why there? Because if you expose math and data to beginning reporters, they will not know any better than to think that math and data are part of the job. Because guess what? Math and data are part of the job.
The argument that I get against adding data to a beginning reporting class is that it can’t be done because we need to spend as much time as possible teaching them how to write and how to report. Learn how to interview people. Learn how to write an effective lead. Learn how to write using AP Style. Learn how to find the news. Learn how to come up with good story ideas. And many of them don’t get enough of all that in beginning reporting. 
And, to be fair, they have a point. Until you write a few thousand leads, they’re hard to do and even harder to do well. For students who don’t read news, finding the news in something is difficult. It takes repetition.
But what if we combined some skills training and showed how one leads to another which leads to another? 
What if we combined the basic math-for-reporters section we teach with how to do those exact same problems with a spreadsheet, and then used that spreadsheet with real data to find real stories? Math + Data = Story ideas. 
Well, I’ve started to do exactly that, and I’m hosting it on GitHub. It’s a work in progress, but the idea is to take basic math skills, show how you can do them on a spreadsheet, then take real data and do the same thing, but this time with an eye toward generating story ideas. I’d like this module to take a week of class time — with in-class and out-of-class learning. 
I have no idea when I’ll be done with it, but I intend to use it in my own beginning reporting class when it’s done. As always, pull requests, issues or criticisms are welcome. 
Some of the math is painfully basic, but I’ve found students who had no idea that mean and average were the same thing. They’d so completely fled from math that concepts like orders of operation were foreign to them. So laugh all you want at some of the topics covered, but I assure you, they’re rooted in experience. 
I have to believe that with a little creativity, the “our curriculum is too full” problem can be solved. I have to believe this because if it can’t, journalism education is screwed.
Somewhere in middle school, I had convinced myself that I was bad at math. It was okay: My mom was bad at math too. So were lots of people I looked up to. “Bad at math” was a thing — probably even genetic — and it was okay.
I so thoroughly convinced myself that I was bad at math that I very nearly didn’t graduate from high school. It took tutors and hours a week to squeak through an advanced algebra class my friends had all breezed through on their way to much harder classes.
But it was okay. I was bad at math. They weren’t. Simple as that.
And it was all a lie.
“Bad at math” is a lie you tell yourself to make failure at math hurt less. That’s all it is. Professors Miles Kimball and Noah Smith wrote in The Atlantic that many of us faced a moment in our lives where we entered a math class that some of us were prepared for and some of us weren’t. Those that got it right away were “good at math” and those who didn’t, well, weren’t. Or so we believed. Those who were good kept working to stay good, and those of us who were bad at it believed the lie.
Now, Kimball and Smith write that bad at math is “the most self-destructive idea in America today.”
Well, Professors Kimball and Smith, welcome to journalism, where “bad at math” isn’t just a destructive idea — it’s a badge of honor. It’s your admission to the club. It’s woven into the very fabric of identity as a journalist.
And it’s a destructive lie. One I would say most journalists believe. It’s a lie that may well be a lurking variable in the death of journalism’s institutions.
Name me a hot growth area in journalism and I’ll show you an area in desperate need of people who can do a bit of math. Data. Programming. Visualization. It’s telling that most of the effort now is around recruiting people from outside journalism to do these things.
But it doesn’t end there. Name me a place where journalism needs help, and I’ll show you more places where math is a daily need: analytics, product development, market analysis. All “business side” jobs, right? Not anymore.
Truth is, “bad at math” was never a good thing in journalism, even when things like data and analytics weren’t a part of the job. Covering a city budget? It’s shameful how many newsroom creatures can’t calculate percent change. Covering sports? It’s embarrassing how many sports writers dismiss the gigantic leaps forward in data analysis in all sports as “nerd stuff.”
In short, we’ve created a culture where ignorance of a subject is not only accepted, it’s glorified. Ha ha! Journalists are bad at math! Fire is hot and water is wet too!
I’m not going to tell you how to get good at math by giving you links to online materials or MOOCs or whatever. I’m not. You can Google. You should do that. No, I’m going to tell you a story.
Through grit and luck and a Hail Mary pass of a grade on a final exam, I did graduate from high school. And in 1993 I went to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the time said the curricular equivalent of “Math? Why the hell do you need math?” I thought this was great. No math? I must be in heaven.
Twenty years later, I’m now a professor in that same journalism school that let me skip out of math. We don’t do that anymore, but our math requirements are pretty thin and universally reviled by students, most of whom would say they’re bad at math. As a professor, I can take classes for free. And it’s abundantly obvious to me that journalism’s problems aren’t with journalism — they’re about money. Where does one go to learn about money? Business school.
So I thought I would get an MBA to better understand the business side of journalism. I walked over to the business college and told them I wanted to do this. “Have you had calculus as an undergrad?” Oh. Uh, no. “Have to have it. It’s an admission requirement.”
So almost two decades to the day that I set foot on campus, there I was, taking a math placement exam. This exam is given to all incoming freshmen to determine which math class they should start with. I took it and could barely read the questions. If they had given me a grade, I would have bombed it. I tested straight into a remedial math class for students who didn’t get enough in high school. Congrats, Math Department: Your test nailed it.
I probably could have crammed and watched Khan Academy videos for hours, taken it again, and landed in a higher math class. But I would have felt like I cheated my way in. And that would have been terrifying. So, I took the class.Math 100A. Just a 37-year-old professor and 30 or so 18-year-old freshmen. Totally normal; I didn’t stick out at all. The instructor was in first grade when I was last in a math class. She asked me what I was doing there. Told her my story. Her reaction: She was bad at math too, until she got to college. Now, she’s getting a Ph.D. in it.
Given all that, I lived in absolute terror that I wouldn’t do well. I sat in the front row. I asked questions non-stop. I did all the homework. I did extra practice problems. I raised my hand to answer questions so much the instructor asked me to stop. I studied for hours.
And I got an A+. I was shocked. And elated. In spite of the fact that I’m a grownup and should get an A in a remedial course, I was pumped up. I can’t remember my last A in math.
On to the next class. Math 101: College Algebra. Just the name gave me chills. I could barely pass high school algebra; how the hell was I going to handle college algebra? Here I was, a grown man with a family and a house and a job and a resume, sweating bullets and losing sleep about a class freshmen take.
Same plan, same result: Work hard, get A+.
I’m halfway through calculus this semester. I have never in my life worked this hard in a class. I’ve never sat awake at night worrying about a class like I have tossing and turning thinking about how to calculate the derivative of something. I can go speak in front of 1,000 people with less than five minutes of preparation and be downright calm compared to the feeling I have going to take a test.
Right now, I’ve got a B+. And if I walk out of there with it, it’ll easily be the most proud of a grade I’ll ever have been.
Why? Because at this level, I’m seeing the consequences of how a student approaches math. On each test, the median score has been around a high F or a low D. The last test saw more than half the class fail. It’s brutal. Of the 111 students in the class, I’m guessing 70 of them will be taking it again.
The only advantage I have over my classmates? I know exactly how to fail at math: Don’t put any effort in. Blow it off. Do something else. A glass of wine and a rerun of Big Bang Theory kicks the crap out of applications of extrema using derivatives, even if you hate wine and loathe Big Bang Theory.
But that’s the lesson I’ve learned: The difference between good at math and bad at math is hard work. It’s trying. It’s trying hard. It’s trying harder than you’ve ever tried before. That’s it.
So do me a favor: Try. Stop with the jokes. Stop telling me, “Oh, I could never do that” when you ask me about math. Because it’s not true. You can. If you try.
You can be good at math.
On deadline, it’s hard to visualize some data that would inform your readers more than the paragraph or two you’re going to have to write out. Even at their peak, there were never enough graphics pros in newsrooms to just toss a chart into a story willy nilly.
There’s a growing selection of tools to fill the need, but most of them fall down in one or more places. They produce cool interactivity but cost money to embed; or they’re free as long as the post doesn’t get too much traffic, which creates perverse incentives; or the learning curve to build something is sky high and requires a professional, which is what we were trying to avoid in the first place.
Enter Chartbuilder, a free tool that makes it stupid easy to make a simple static chart of some basic data and get it into your publication. It really just involves copying, pasting, tweaking and exporting. The output is an image — no interactivity — but that’s an advantage, not a drawback. You want a chart in less than 10 minutes that requires no magic to get online? Here you go.
And, it’s open source. Don’t like something? You’re free to fork it and change it yourself. You can alter the styling to fit your publication’s look and feel. You can do whatever you want. Go wild.
If all you want to do is kick the tires, the father of Chartbuilder, David Yanofsky,pointed out on Twitter there’s a hosted version here. You can skip down to the Using Chartbuilder parts below where I’ve included some data for you to try out.
But if you want to change the style on your charts, or if you want your own version running locally, or if you just want to learn something about the command line while trying out a new tool, read on.
In terms of installing Chartbuilder, it’s pretty easy. My only beef with it — and it’s a minor quibble I’ll fix right now — is that the instructions assume you know your way around a computer like a developer does. If you’re not that person, the first steps to using Chartbuilder are a doozy.
The best thing to do is to give you an example and walk you through it.
Let’s play pretend.
You now live in Lincoln, Neb., where for nearly the entire month of July, we didn’t have a drop of rain. Last summer was one of the worst droughts on record. At that time, the city put watering restrictions into place that made it a misdemeanor crime to water on the wrong day. There was a lot of anger —and some funny moments — to go with it.
So the fear around town was that with so little rain, watering restrictions would return. The city put up the same signs from last year, warning that if people didn’t start using less water, rate hikes and mandatory restrictions were coming.
And then something remarkable happened: It started raining. A lot. And people stopped watering their lawns.
I can tell you all this, but you really don’t know how much a little rain makes a difference until you make a chart. So let’s use Chartbuilder to do just that.
How to set it up
Using a Mac or Linux? Good news, you’ve got what you need. Skip to the next part.
Using Windows? The bad news is you need to install Python. The good news is, it’s not that hard if you have administrative rights on your computer.
First, download and install Python 2.7. Get it here.
Next, after you’ve installed Python, you need to tell Windows that you’ve installed Python and that when you type ‘python’ on the command line, use Python. It all sounds strange, but to do this, you have to change something called an environment variable. Specifically, you need to add Python to your path.
To do that on Windows, it’s a little different for each version, so you might have to Google how to do it. On Windows 7, you’ll need to open a Control Panel, go to System and Security, then System, then click Advanced system settings.

Data journalism, meet sensor journalism. You two should talk.
What’s sensor journalism? I’ll get to that. But first, let me tell you a story about bugs — and a pair of gadgets that sat for months in a box under John Keefe’s bed.
Keefe, senior editor for data news and journalism technology at WNYC in New York, said by phone that he had bought the Arduino microcontroller and Raspberry Pi with great excitement, played with them for a weekend, and then boxed them up. But he kept kicking around ideas about what you could do with a small computer paired with sensors or other devices. And when asked what WNYC was doing about the 17-year cicadas that will emerge from the earth like insect zombies this summer, Keefe wondered if the answer might be under his bed.
Keefe learned that when the soil eight inches down reaches 64 degrees for a few days, cicadas emerge to fill summer nights with their songs. And so he asked himself: Could WNYC build a sensor to find out when they’re coming?
A few days later, at an internal WNYC hackathon, Keefe presented the idea of building a cicada sensor. He gathered a team interested in trying and took a field trip to Radio Shack. By the end of the hackathon, they had a device … and backing from the station’s managers. With proof of concept in hand, they moved on to how to make more cicada sensors and teach listeners to make their own. After beta-testing those instructions at March’s NICAR data-journalism conference, they announced the project at SXSW Interactive a few weeks later.
The Cicada Tracker has taken off from there: WNYC is now planning a pair of hack days: one where more than 250 volunteers will build sensors and another where New York schoolchildren will make even more cicada trackers.
The devices report the temperature of the ground, which reports plotted as colored dots on WNYC’s website. Click a dot, see the temperature. Volunteers hosting a device are asked to report in regularly. Dozens of people, from as far west as Goshen, Ind., and as far south as Jacksonville, Fla., are doing just that, with more dots added to the map all the time.
“The whole time, I’m thinking this is cool — a little ridiculous, but cool,” Keefe recalls.
But that’s part of sensor journalism’s appeal: It’s cool. And cool opens the imagination to other possibilities. This time it’s cicadas, but next time it might be pollution, or some other public health issue.
“There’s clearly technology to do anything we want to do,” Keefe says. “There’s just not enough people there bridging the gap. What’s missing now is the journalism.”
So what would that journalism look like? It’s too soon for any real definitive answers, but this post from O’Reilly’s Alex Howard might get minds working. So — I hope — will a little experiment I conducted on my own.
What sensors do best is detect characteristics of the physical world — properties such as light, heat, sound, pressure, vibration, air quality and moisture.
I’ve been interested in the idea of using a sensor network to detect noise pollution, answering in real time which neighborhoods are louder than others and exploring why. But in a decent-sized city that would take hundreds if not thousands of sensors. And would it even work?
Instead of talking about it, I decided to build a prototype.
For parts, I needed three things: a sound sensor, a computer brain to run it and a place to store the data.
The best-known tool of the open hardware movement is the Arduino, which costs about $30 and fits in the palm of your hand. It’s a microcontroller that can run on a little bit of electricity and control simple things, such as sensors.
Then there are “shields,” which are other circuit boards that do something and plug straight into the Arduino, no soldering required. They can cost anywhere from a few dollars to more than $100, depending on what they do. I have anArduino Ethernet Shield, which happens to have an SD card slot on it — a convenient place to store a bunch of data.
The sound sensor that I bought — really a microphone and a tiny amplifier — cost $7.

A few days later, at an internal WNYC hackathon, Keefe presented the idea of building a cicada sensor. He gathered a team interested in trying and took a field trip to Radio Shack. By the end of the hackathon, they had a device … and backing from the station’s managers. With proof of concept in hand, they moved on to how to make more cicada sensors and teach listeners to make their own. After beta-testing those instructions at March’s NICAR data-journalism conference, they announced the project at SXSW Interactive a few weeks later.
The Cicada Tracker has taken off from there: WNYC is now planning a pair of hack days: one where more than 250 volunteers will build sensors and another where New York schoolchildren will make even more cicada trackers.
The devices report the temperature of the ground, which reports plotted as colored dots on WNYC’s website. Click a dot, see the temperature. Volunteers hosting a device are asked to report in regularly. Dozens of people, from as far west as Goshen, Ind., and as far south as Jacksonville, Fla., are doing just that, with more dots added to the map all the time.
“The whole time, I’m thinking this is cool — a little ridiculous, but cool,” Keefe recalls.
But that’s part of sensor journalism’s appeal: It’s cool. And cool opens the imagination to other possibilities. This time it’s cicadas, but next time it might be pollution, or some other public health issue.
“There’s clearly technology to do anything we want to do,” Keefe says. “There’s just not enough people there bridging the gap. What’s missing now is the journalism.”
So what would that journalism look like? It’s too soon for any real definitive answers, but this post from O’Reilly’s Alex Howard might get minds working. So — I hope — will a little experiment I conducted on my own.
What sensors do best is detect characteristics of the physical world — properties such as light, heat, sound, pressure, vibration, air quality and moisture.
I’ve been interested in the idea of using a sensor network to detect noise pollution, answering in real time which neighborhoods are louder than others and exploring why. But in a decent-sized city that would take hundreds if not thousands of sensors. And would it even work?
Instead of talking about it, I decided to build a prototype.
For parts, I needed three things: a sound sensor, a computer brain to run it and a place to store the data.
The best-known tool of the open hardware movement is the Arduino, which costs about $30 and fits in the palm of your hand. It’s a microcontroller that can run on a little bit of electricity and control simple things, such as sensors.
Then there are “shields,” which are other circuit boards that do something and plug straight into the Arduino, no soldering required. They can cost anywhere from a few dollars to more than $100, depending on what they do. I have anArduino Ethernet Shield, which happens to have an SD card slot on it — a convenient place to store a bunch of data.
The sound sensor that I bought — really a microphone and a tiny amplifier — cost $7.
The wiring for my little prototype was super simple. It needed power — so first I soldered red wire to the 5v spot on the sensor and plugged it into the 5v pin on the Arduino. Then I soldered a black wire to plug into the Arduino’s ground pin. And then the data output wire went into an analog serial port where the values coming from it could be read. Through the software uploaded to the Arduino, the output value gets recorded. The program says, basically: read the sound sensor data from the wire, write it to the SD card, wait a tenth of a second, then do it again. Rinse. Repeat.
After testing my device, I plugged it in and placed it in the lobby of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It’s not a loud place, most of the time, and it’s not a truly quiet place, most of the time.
For hours, my device kept recording data: 707,122 times, to be exact, for a total of 1.96 hours of readings (at a tenth of a second each). Looking over the data, 684,811 times my device recorded … nothing. Meaning that for 1.9 of the 1.96 hours of the sampled data, things were pretty quiet around it. (That doesn’t mean it was silent. It just means my sensor didn’t pick up any noise.)
For the other samples, most noise levels were between 1 and 15 on the sensor’s scale. To put that in perspective, my speaking voice five feet from the device measures between 6 and 9, and clapping my hands five feet away is between 50 and 70. There were seven readings between 50 and 70 throughout the day, almost certainly the front door closing at the precise moment the sensor tuned in for a listen.
A graph of the readings shows the range of the values, but leaves the impression that it was noisier than it was. Remember: 97 percent of the time, the sensor heard nothing. In an academic building’s lobby, that’s not surprising. If this were at a construction site, I’d question the results.
So what did I learn? I learned it’s possible to monitor noise for five hours using a battery pack. I learned my sensor might not be sensitive enough — I should spend more than $7. I learned my code would keep writing out data, even when that file started to get big — it’s 2.1 megabytes of text.
And most importantly, I learned we can do this.
And right now, that’s a key lesson: We can do this, so what stories should we be chasing? What’s possible? What’s feasible?
One of the things that intrigues me about sensor journalism is its potential for crowdsourcing — letting people help sense changes in their local environment. We can build ideas that let people know data about their own location, and feed that data into a greater whole.
For instance, with our noise sensor, we could look at noise by neighborhood. Are poor neighborhood louder than rich neighborhoods? That would have public health consequences. (To oversimplify: noise causes stress, stress causes heart problems, heart problems cause death.) Or we could evaluate how zoning changes or road construction alters daily life in a neighborhood.
Want another example? UNL student Ben Kreimer and I built a device that sensed how my luggage was being treated as we travelled to NICAR this year. Our device was simple — an accelerometer similar to the one in your smartphone that you use to play video games that sent data to an SD card. It recorded data all the way through the check-in and loading process, with the battery dying as the plane started to taxi. Our data showed us that 1) the parking lot of the airport is a terrible surface; 2) the TSA pulled the device out of my bag to look at it; and 3) your bag mostly sits, going nowhere, until it’s time to get on the plane. Then? Wham!
And that left Ben and I thinking … what’s next? We have some ideas. So does Keefe.
And that’s what’s needed right now — ideas. Journalists thinking about stories they could tell if only they had some data. Which, as stories like ours show, they can get with relatively little money and effort, if they’re willing to veer well outside the usual tools journalists work with.
“The more we show people, what else can we unlock?” Keefe wonders.

Toward a solution to the more tech in J-school problem
First, lets state some general conditions and agree to them:
There is a generally agreed upon need for tomorrow’s journalists — no matter what area of the craft they intend to go into — to have more technological skill and experience than their past counterparts.
There is not a generally agreed upon way to accomplish this increase in technological skill within a j-school curriculum.
There is not a generally agreed upon list of tech skills that journalism students should/must have before graduating to become a journalist today.
There is a … tension … in newsrooms and faculties over the balance between focusing on reporting/storytelling/fundamental skills and on new technologies for storytelling. Whether you believe this tension is well founded or a not-mutually-exclusive waste of time, it exists and must be acknowledged.
There are a finite number of classes a student can take in any major and the list of skills and tech that have come up at various discussions and conferences vastly outstrips this class hour limit.
I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. It started with me thinking about what is the technological/computer science answer to Doing More With Less. Ah yes, Doing More With Less, the trite bullshit line publishers trot out after axing half the staff. It is bullshit, but there’s also a legit question there. How could you do more with less, because guess what? There’s less. A lot less. Ignoring that is angrily yelling at clouds. Pointless.
In academia, the do more with less argument isn’t necessarily about less. It’s about an absolute limit. There are only so many credit hours a student can take in their major. In that limit you have to teach, you know, Journalism. Reporting, writing, editing, design, photography, videography, “the basics.” You don’t hear from people anymore arguing that these classes shouldn’t include more tech. For example, traditional print reporting classes are using digital recorders and cameras on smart phones and video cameras and live tweeting to cover stories. J-schools, by and large, have made that adjustment, from what I hear from my colleagues around the country. The classroom reporting classes are trying to mimic the professional experience, and that has meant more tech.
The question, then, is how do you get some of these other emerging ideas into the curriculum? Where does programming fit in? Or mobile design? What about completely out-there ideas that should be getting a test run in a university setting before going out into the broader industry? Like drones? Or sensor networks? Or machine learning? Or algorithm-written stories? How do you fit those into a curriculum many believe is busy enough teaching “the basics”? How do you deal with a not-insignificant number of people who don’t believe any of this should be in the curriculum at all?
My thinking lately?
Don’t. 
Just don’t. Forget the curriculum. Forget classes. Do something outside of class. Create an opportunity that doesn’t have credit hours attached that has value and fire away.
What do I mean by this?
If you’ve been paying attention around these parts lately, you’ll know that I’ve started a Drone Journalism Lab and have just entered the Knight News Challenge with an idea of building sensor networks for news. I get asked regularly, are you going to teach a class in drones or sensors?
Nope.
Couple of reasons for that. First and foremost, I want to be clear that both are just tools. A smartphone is a really great tool for storytelling that opens all kinds of ethical questions about their use. Would you teach a class in smartphones? No, you wouldn’t. That’d be silly. So using a drone to report a story is … slightly more complicated … but similar to using a smartphone to report a story. It’s a tool to tell a story. It’s not a completely new form of story. Might drones end up in other classes? Yep. Count on it. Sensors? Yep, count on it. Are they their own classes? I don’t think so. I can make an argument for them being their own class, but for now I’m saying no.
So what are they? 
Every campus has student media where students take what they learned in class and apply it to doing more journalism. They get more experience. In sports, they’re called repetitions or reps. The more reps you get, the better you get, the more you can do. Students need reps.  But J-school isn’t the only place for this. Other disciplines have students who work in labs as lab techs or research assistants. They get paid, they get experience, they get reps. 
So what if we did this for journalism too?
I called it the Drone Journalism Lab for a reason. It’s going to be a lab. Where students work. And through grants and undergraduate research programs, they’ll get paid to do so.  They’ll get hands on experience with a very interesting technology, get to take part in the research and they’ll get to put it on their resumes. And given the number of news organizations that have asked me about it, they’ll have no trouble finding a job if this all goes according to plan. Number of classes required? Zero.
The Knight News Challenge app? A good portion of the funds requested is to pay students to work on the project. Again, hands on, in the lab, taking part, without course credit on the line. No need for a curriculum committee meeting. No need to fret about what basic skill is going to get short shrift because we’re talking about sensors.
I’ve talked about starting a hacker space here in the college where students could hang out and build stuff. A kind of proto-incubator stage space where students build things they can then take and build a business around. At the time I was thinking about web stuff or Kinect hacks or things like that. But now I’m thinking it could be a whole universe of things. And again, not things in the curriculum.
I have no idea if this is a solution or not, but it seems to solve a lot of problems. It creates some problems — space, funding, resources to name a few, plus how do you measure this for faculty time commitments? I’m sure it causes more problems than that. I just haven’t thought of them yet.
But if you believe J-school needs more tech, and you accept the reality that universities aren’t going to allow us to double the number of credit hours required to get a degree, then these kinds of outside-the-curriculum ideas are part of the future.
News nerd rage: the trouble with conferences
I’ve been having somewhat of an existential crisis of late. I’ve been a speaker at multiple journalism conferences a year for more than a decade running now and I have started to wonder at the value of all that talking. Not that I feel all those sessions weren’t valuable — they were — but were they as valuable as they could have been? Could we have gotten a few more people over the wall? Could we have snagged a few more minds? 
Michelle Minkoff has been thinking about this too, and asked me for some advice. You should head over and read her post. It’s what got me off the carpet to write what’s rattling around in my head.
Every journalism conference I’ve been to are 90 percent panel discussions, maybe some hands-on classes and the remainder keynote speeches with a Big Name Speaker. How each conference selects speakers varies — some identify people who would be interesting on a given topic and invite them, others invite speakers to propose panels. 
What I’ve come to believe:
The best panels are about things *anyone* can do, not about some crazy thing you did that no one will ever be able to do or only works because of some cosmic combination of factors in your city or state.
Panels are a really, really crappy forum for very specific technical information. 
The best panels entertain and inspire as much as they inform. They tell a story, from speaker to speaker to speaker. There is laughter and people leave the room ready to run through a brick wall. More tent revival, less reading bullet points. 
The problem with this line of thinking:
Not everyone can inspire or entertain. There is a legit “diversity of voices” argument to be had about journalism conference panel speakers and it goes beyond the YAFWG (yet another f**king white guy) argument. Being a good speaker is a really good skill to have but it shouldn’t eliminate you from the speakers list. 
We’ve shown people The Light! They’re ready to go out and do what you inspired them to do! Congrats. You’ve rubbed them on the carpet, sent them running out the door to … what? A newsroom that doesn’t care? A life of blindly Googling for help? There are people who take this challenge and thrive. There are far more people who are confronted with the vastness of the unknown and quit.
So, what can we do about this?
I think we have to rethink the News Nerd/technical journalism panel. We have to quit fooling ourselves that an hour at a conference is sufficient to do anything more than hold someone’s attention for an hour. We have to stop inspiring people and then giving them little direction after they walk out.
In Michelle’s post, Jeremy Bowers at the Washington Post sums it up thusly:
"There’s missing support for the middle-class of news developers. This is a particularly glaring gap, because it’s the most difficult part of the incubation of the adolescent coder."
I think I have an idea that might work.
Proposed: The Super Panel. It goes like this.
We start with a panel designed specifically around inspiring, entertaining and informing. We make no secret of this — we celebrate it, in fact. We choose speakers specifically because they inspire and entertain.
After the panel, those so moved are invited to an unconference-style session where the people who want to go further are thrown together with the panel’s speakers and others recruited to help to map out the next moves. Install some software? Map out a group project? Start hacking away? Up to those who show up.
After the conference, the super panel speakers plus those recruited to help agree to run a study group/mentoring program online. Maybe through Google Groups. Maybe something else. I don’t know. Haven’t thought this all the way out. The point being there’s a support group of people who were at this session who are working on a project together to learn after the conference is over. There’s infrastructure and support in place after you leave.
I realize this completely changes the dynamic for panel speakers: Done right, there’s a lot of work that goes into preparing for a panel. This adds to that 100 times over. I also realize also that not every panel and not every panelist is cut out for this. But it seems like every conference could do a handful of these Super Panels in addition to the normal panels. Nobody has time to start some online study group based on every panel they went to at a three day conference. But one? Two? If they really want it they will make time. 
I think Super Panels would serve several purposes: First, it would take away the argument that conferences leave people high and dry and all alone after they’re over. Second, it would leave someone who claims that they want to learn this stuff with a lot fewer excuses. Third, it would much better serve this middle class of news nerd who is already in the choir, enjoys but doesn’t need the sermon and wants the technical stuff that just doesn’t come across well in a panel. 
Thoughts? Improvements?
Edit: See this if you think 1) I’m being specifically critical of any one organization and 2) you think I’m just writing this to write it instead of doing something about it.

"@kleinmatic I've had more than a few people say ""but what about the hallway track?"" I think there's a balance to be found here."
@mattwynn See previous tweet. You're comfortable with that. Many -- most? -- aren't. How do we get them over the wall?
"@markng @kleinmatic Right, but you're also comfortable with learning on your own. Many -- most? -- aren't. How can we help them?"
@kleinmatic I say you can't learn anything if you don't go back to your life and use it. So how do we ensure more do?

@ryanpitts @jeremybowers I think I'll respond with this: http://ind.pn/giUix9
"@mgrad92 Obviously, a couple of CMS vendors think otherwise."
@mgrad92 The short version is that I and others believe there are ways to deal with this without resorting to freely editable urls.
"@mgrad92 So, in my opinion, multiple urls are like putting a gun in a day care. Properly locked? No problem. Improper? Bad, bad, bad."
"@mgrad92 If not properly implemented with a canonical url directive, Sptimes/Wapo systems are SEO death. Multiple urls means google splits."
"@mgrad92 Two thoughts: Not really but it could be better, but that also not PolitiFact's publication style."
"@mgrad92 Superusers do. Angie, Amy, Bill, etc. It's not something we expose to everyone. Also, slug editing is something we discourage."
@mgrad92 But we also have a redirects app in PolitiFact that allows an editor to change a well indexed url and redirect the old url to new.
"@mgrad92 99 times out of 100, any changes happen before people have linked to it or its been indexed in google, so no big deal."
"@mgrad92 So yes, change it and the old one breaks. So you don't do it for giggles."
@mgrad92 There is no lock in the sense that it's always editable. But that flexibility comes at a cost -- there is one and only one url.
@robquig And fake too. You can edit the url string to whatever you want. Example: http://ind.pn/gc1ERY
"@ryanpitts @jeremybowers Which I believe is based on the Sumerian ""muuche"" which translates to ""herp derp works so ship it"""

@DailyNeb Or ask UNLPD for calls for service data. Dan's memory is not a primary source.
@kickme444 Agreed.
"@kickme444 And honestly, I'm more interested to see what devs will do with the code beyond what's provided. Will it inspire others? Hope so."
@kickme444 But it's a fair question -- what is being provided that a couple of devs and a framework couldn't do? My take? A head start.
"@kickme444 Journalists, by and large, suck at money. Knight may -- this is my guess -- like that Armstrong makes money easier for j-startups"
"@kickme444 And the non-profit domain specific tools -- membership, etc. -- that give other non-profits a head start."

"@kickme444 You probably know more about the state of the code than I do at this point, but my guess? A head start and a road map."
@kleinmatic That help at all?
@jashkenas I wish I knew. I'm sure @HotTypeLLC will be involved somehow but you know as much as I do right now.
@kleinmatic So that generic content model has very few assumptions about what your content should look like.
@kleinmatic The one real technical assumption is that you're going to want to trash anything and everything and rebuild it as things evolve.
@kleinmatic It's predicated around the idea of a generic content model that can be inherited and plugged into anything with ease.
"@kleinmatic However, from my perspective, it attempts to solve the problem of the tools of a CMS + the flexibility of a framework."
@kleinmatic I'm honestly not the best person to answer anymore. It's been in continuous development since launch in 2009.

"@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore My consulting company, @HotTypeLLC, helped build version .1 of Armstrong."
"@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore And, the code will be on Github (I believe). Fork it and go wild."
"@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore But because it's built on a framework, hacking away at it isn't fraught with peril like other options."
"@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore Meaning it has a generic content model you can inherit and extend all you want, seamlessly integrated."
"@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore And, the Knight annoucement today is a real opportunity. It's a CMS with the benefits of a framework."
"@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore I don't believe my arg is The Right One, but I don't see anyone really blowing up content assumptions."
@kevglobal @markng @martinjemoore I understand the arg about collecting bespoke CMS's. I offered my essay as a counter to One CMS Only.
@markng @kevglobal @martinjemoore My arg is that real innovation can be found in chaining data directly into core content. That said ...

"@keithpille Anymore, what's the difference between Perez Hilton and political news? I would argue politics is almost more theatrical."
"@wmhiggins Or are a niche unto their own, gathering in specific places where the like minded gather, which is to say NOT on newspaper.coms?"
"@wmhiggins Ah, but that's my point: What if those people exist only in our minds? What if serious commentary is unsustainably small market?"
@derekwillis That's what I'm driving at: Why do you believe that? Why do you believe the audience would choose better if presented it?
@keithpille Could I live with myself? Nope. Could I sustain a business that kept people employed and families fed? Maybe.
"@derekwillis Look at the audience numbers vs. what critics call ""good"" TV. Ask what market is saying. I don't believe my arg, but what if?"

@derekwillis I see the same names attached to new news apps. I see the same faces at CAR conferences. Where's the next wave?
@derekwillis Why aren't there newsapps developers in more newsrooms? Why aren't we seeing LA style crime apps elsewhere?
"@derekwillis No question. I'm not arguing that newsapps are flawed or that we shouldn't be doing them. I'm saying, why not more?"
@sdoig Sure. I personally peg the dawn of modernity to the death of the dummy terminal and the mass adoption of Windows in newsrooms.
Yep because those in charge don't have the skills RT @MacDivaONA: @mattwaite But co.s don't emphasize that CAR is a necessary general skill.
"@derekwillis We should have more influence on that response, given that story. But we don't. And thus my disappointment."
"@derekwillis Thus, my argument that we're not doing a good enough job selling. We have demonstrated successes and a story to tell."
"@derekwillis Agreed, but what @kleinmatic said: The house is on fire. You'd expect some urgency."
@derekwillis @kleinmatic How long? The late 60s. I would say we entered modernity in the early 90s with the advent of newsroom PCs.
Journalists in Norway -- the motherland for me -- getting in on the newsapp action http://bit.ly/dK9U8j via @JohnEi
"@kleinmatic I wish that were true. I'm not convinced that it is. If it were, the next wave of news app developers and CAR pros would be here"
"@derekwillis So why hasn't it happened? What's stopping it from happening, from everyone saying ""hey, I can do that"" both CAR and news apps?"
@derekwillis And I think there's spillover to programming -- that it's some higher plane of existence unobtainable to journalists.
@derekwillis We both have dealt with people who view percent change in a spreadsheet as equal to differential calculus.
"@derekwillis It can't hurt. But part of me wonders if there isn't some fundamental block, like those proud that journalists can't do math."
"RT @angieholan: @mattwaite @MargotWilliams Skills gap among most reporters still profound. Twitter is easy compared to a href, which too ..."
"@MargotWilliams Given the overwhelming hype that twitter/social media is getting compared to CAR/data/newsapps, are you surprised?"
Agreed RT @amyjobr: @mattwaite re: tinkering w/ building blocks - Need to build whole new infrastructure to make it work efficiently.
"@alanmclean Oh, agreed. Completely, totally agreed. Also part of our failure to properly sell the idea."
"@jeremybowers I think they're using BRAWNDO, THE THIRST MUTILATOR!"
@schwanksta That and your crime app are shining examples. But where are the copy cats? Murders only happen in LA? Crime just a SoCal thing?
"@jeremybowers @harrisj @kleinmatic That reminds me, would someone at the SP Times water our newsapps farm? The crops are getting parched."
"@alanmclean But, I think you have a point: How good of a job are we doing selling apps? The answer, I think, is not good enough."
"@alanmclean Obvious troll is obvious, but I'll bite: The apps I've built have demonstrable success, from the journalism to the business."
Got to get my son at pre-school. Will pick this up when I get back. Still waiting for someone to tell me I'm wrong.
"@harrisj @kleinmatic And many believe an unsplittable, unalterable atom. And @politifact, I think, proves otherwise. But it's a lonely exmpl"
@kleinmatic I think it goes beyond just that. There are enemies inside the gate as well as outside.
"@kleinmatic By core, I mean the story form itself. Approaching a story as an app. Really truly tinkering with the building blocks."
"@harrisj More skills. That everyone would see the white hot logic of ""Data is part of the future"" and invest in learning skills to improve."
Also: My disappointment is an echo of my disappointment in how the oft-predicted mass adoption of CAR by all reporters never happened.
@kleinmatic Agreed. My disappointment is not in what's being done. It's amazing. But where's the cavalry? Where's the critical mass?
"@harrisj @mikejcorey It's a good thing to build an app out of data, no doubt. But what about the core of news? When do we get to touch that?"
@harrisj @mikejcorey But I think this is the source of my disappointment: Where is the news appification of stories themselves?
"So @NiemanLab have asked me to write a State of News Apps post. My take, in a word, is disappointed, in spite of successes. Why am I wrong?"
"This. RT @jpgillin: @mattwaite Barbecue-loving, data-crunching journalism refugee. Needs time to mow lawn and play video games. The End."

"@jameswilkerson Like I said, don't like it? Do something. Your paycheck isn't funded by journalistic ideals. Take control before they do."
@skins96 How many of us have written a business plan with our projects with a sales strategy and marketing opportunities included?
"@jameswilkerson Yeah, I'm projecting now. But it holds everywhere. You want to win a fight with an ad sales manager? Know thy enemy."
@mattwynn Not where I come from. There's not a publisher on the face of the earth right now that won't listen to ideas on how to make money.
"@skins96 Zero idea. But PolitiFact is also an example of the problem. We did it as journalism uber alles, not a business. A mistake, IMHO."
"@skins96 And being argumentative is what I asked for. Instead of knee-jerk wailing, challenge assumptions. Learn. Adapt."

@kleinmatic But who says those things are mutually exclusive? Who says reader trust and paying the bills can't exist together?
@skins96 My equally smartass response is are you is are you so insecure in your news judgment that you can't defend it?
"@mikejcorey Personally, I *want* it to be the other way. I want journalists to grow up and take cntrl of their own fate, incld. biz issues"
@skins96 Depends. Strong brand with mass audience loyalty sells a lot more than $1m in ads. Are we fighting battles or wars here?
Another thought: How many rounds of cuts are we away from having too few managers to even specialize?
"@kleinmatic I loathe laboratory conditions. Real world, where it's messy, fault ridden, often irrational and never as bad as you think."
"@kleinmatic Viewed narrowly, I agree. But I've met ad people with better news sense than some editors I've known."
@kleinmatic My broader point is this: Don't like reporting to an ad sales manager? Do something about it. Think about more than journalism.
"@kleinmatic Nope, I think this move is about doing something more than wishing the massive disruption at metro papers would go away."
"@kleinmatic The right move? No, I don't believe it is. But doing something is better than, say, prayer or cursing Google."

"@jenkinsa Oh, and that thing I wanted to read? Not on the mobile site. All requests from mobile browsers get shunted to mobile homepage."
Tampa area folk: Craig Pittman and I will be talking about and signing copies of Paving Paradise at Inkwood Books on Armenia in Tampa at 2.
Today's garage sale has been a smashing success thanks to one lady with a fist full of cash and a full sized truck.

@stovak Thanks but much love to @catlips and @jeremybowers for the awesome UI on mugshots.
@stovak On mugshots? Django. Amazon S3 for static media. Postgres for the database. Memcached for caching. Worked very well so far.
@pilhofer I think it's because we published some of the stories in the paper and submitted a few of those with the entry. But yeah. Odd.
Thanks everyone. I'll respond to your many questions in the morning.

@jiconoclast One hitch in all this: carriers don't want open mobile web. They don't want to be dumb pipes. They want a cut.
@jiconoclast I think open mobile web is inevitable -- through telcos or via tech like WiMax -- but carriers going to fight it every step.
@jiconoclast All three browsers you mention are hopeful signs. But they're meaningless unless Verizon or TMobile puts them on phones.
"@jiconoclast Who wins? I don't know. I hope consumers, but you're talking about billions of dollars the carriers will fight hard to keep."

@justinlilly Hard to say -- I know some programmers who can't write to save their lives and talking to strangers is painful.
"@justinlilly For me, its been much harder to learn programming than reporting, but each discipline attracts different personalities."
At LAX. Going to be in the air while our first Twitter experiment goes on.

Margot is a fan of http://pipl.com/ to find people on the web.
maplight.org = awesome. They're just doing some extremely cool things with things we should all know about: politics and money.
At Knight Digital Media Center's Election 2008 conference. Speakers now talking about candidates and consultants uses of the web.

I'm pretty sure that Larry Makinson has forgotten more about campaign finance this week than I have ever known about it. Always interesting.
Makinson: Internet money is the cleanest money in politics right now. I'll stress right now.
"Bill Allison: ""Congress is like a giant flea market."" Lots of stuff for sale. Sponsoring bills, blocking them, hearings, earmarks, etc."
Allison (of Sunlight) is praising (Sunlight grantee) opencongress.org. Called it Facebook for congressional geeks.

Our first twitter experiment -- twittering this weekend's NFL draft -- now has 50 followers. That's about 48 more than I thought.
"@mapgoblin Print promos, a link at http://www.tampabay.com/sports/, and 4 are staffers (I think)."
Taking a new environment out for a spin. I love the smell of new servers in the morning.
"So, for giggles, we decided to Twitter this weekend's NFL draft. Print promo this weekend brought in 30 followers a week early. Nice."

@scavendish: tell me you ate at ninfas.
@scavendish: They were wrong.
@scavendish: Ninfas fajitas were a religious experience. This from a Norwegian-raised man who views spices as a sin.
My brain is that mushy consistency you get when you've been working way above your head all day long.
This just in: I hate IE 6.
@scavendish @patrickbeeson I wish the good Lord would come down and smite it off the face of the planet. IE needs a good smiting.
@scavendish Dude. You HAVE to eat at place called Nifas while in Houston. Top 10 meals of my life. On Navigation Street.
@scavendish Use? Never. Code pages so it works on IE 6 because 20 percent of our users still use it? Unfortunately yes.
@scavendish Only the greatest Tex Mex I've ever had. Transcendently awesome Tex Mex.

@shawnsmith - Even we don't believe it. That whole thing is run out of the business side. News has nothing to do with it.

@shawnsmith -- you aren't alone.

@ryansholin: re: your reason: Do you honestly believe that's the case with my publication?
@ryansholin - I have no doubt. I can hear the old timer talking in my head.

Back to work after two days of wishing for death on the couch. F***king colds.
My life is immeasurably better because new episodes of Battlestar Galactica are on Hulu.com.
@mizzousundevil Best show on TV. Now best show on the internets.
"@jiconoclast - But how could they get you to buy the DVDs then? I agree, but I'm also fascinated by hulu's biz model."
"@mapgoblin - I will whore out my allegiances in a heartbeat for BSG. I love the show that much. It's NBC Universal I'm angry with, not BSG."

"@eyeseast It's all I'm doing these days. The new mattwaite.com runs on GeoDjango, though you wouldn't know it. Lots of map projects coming."
@jiconoclast Slicehost. I've set up two slices with Django now and I've been really pleased.
@jiconoclast Your VPN is up and as secure as you make it. That's the beauty and the terror of having your own. No one else is doing it.
Sad to report that my cool thing for the internets is getting held until Sunday. And its not as cool anymore. Damned newspaper mentality.
I'm making something kinda cool for the internets that will actually appear tomorrow.

@mapgoblin Why choose? Why not cryptically vague? Or vaguely cryptic?
The random number vs seed winning percentage Excel spreadsheet has taken a serious beating.
The random number vs seed winning percentage Excel spreadsheet bracket maker went 14-2 on day one. Overpicked the 5/12 upset.

@Journerdism: Welcome to the midwest. Don't like the weather? Wait 10 minutes.
I'm teaching a class in Django right now. Say hello class.
mattwaite.com is slowing creeping toward life. It's on a new server now. That server is running a crazy bleeding edge verison of GeoDjango.
@scavendish: I am this close to driving to Chicago and killing you. THIS close.
@scavendish: Keep singing. I dare you. I double dare you.
Watching the Django bootcamp getting started. It's going well. No one has freaked out yet.
"@scavendish -- Dude, I've seen some stuff here that isn't even part of the conference that has melted my brain."

I now have my own VPS and will be rebuilding mattwaite.com as a Django joint.
My blog is dead. It may not be coming back. Time to try Twitter for real.
"@mapgoblin I think the support people called it ""unscheduled emergency maintenance"" of the database server. Left me with nothing."
"Am I unreasonable in thinking that 18 hours without a response to my data being lost is unacceptable? Can I at least have a ""we're on it?"""
They responded. It's all gone. It isn't coming back.
@mapgoblin It would appear that the backups were on the same server as the database server. They got maybe 10 percent of my data back.
mattwaite.com will rise from the ashes as a hand rolled Django app on a new server. God as my witness.
"@mapgoblin Wow, Google Reader has every post I've done since October 2005. Thanks for the tip!"
